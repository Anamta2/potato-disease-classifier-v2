# Potato Disease Classification

A machine learning project for classifying potato plant diseases using deep learning techniques. This system can identify healthy potato plants and detect common diseases including Early Blight and Late Blight with high accuracy.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify potato plant diseases from leaf images. The model achieves over 95% accuracy in distinguishing between healthy plants and those affected by Early Blight or Late Blight diseases.

## üîç Disease Classes

The model classifies potato plants into three categories:
- **Healthy**: Normal, disease-free potato plants
- **Early Blight**: Caused by *Alternaria solani*
- **Late Blight**: Caused by *Phytophthora infestans*

## üìä Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: ~95%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~97%
- **Model Confidence**: Up to 90% for disease predictions
- **Training Loss**: Converged to ~0.2
- **Validation Loss**: Converged to ~0.1

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potato-disease-classification.git
   cd potato-disease-classification
   ```

2. **Install API dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd potato_diseases_clean/api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install training dependencies** (for Jupyter notebook)
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas
   ```

## üîß Usage

### Training the Model

1. Open the training notebook:
   ```bash
   cd potato_diseases_clean/training_model
   jupyter notebook training.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells to train the model from scratch
3. The trained model will be saved for use with the API

### Running the API

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   cd potato_diseases_clean/api
   python main.py
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

3. Access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Making Predictions

Send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with an image file:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/predict"
files = {"file": open("potato_leaf.jpg", "rb")}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)
print(response.json())
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "class": "late_blight",
  "confidence": 0.9033572673797607,
  "all_predictions": {
    "Early blight": 0.09663786739110947,
    "late blight": 0.9033572673797607,
    "healthy": 4.856416580878431e-06
  }
}
```
